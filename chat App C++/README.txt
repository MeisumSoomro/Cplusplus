This is a simple example of a chat application with a client-server architecture.


The server needs to be started first. It sets up a socket and waits for a client to connect.
    
The client, once started, establishes a connection to the server.

The client sends messages to the server, which the server then echoes back, demonstrating a basic two-way communication.

When the client sends "exit", both the client and server close their connections.




How can you implement better message handling in this app? 
Perhaps with support for multiple clients that want to communicate? 

Real-world apps would involve more robust error handling and security measures. 
How would you handle this?
